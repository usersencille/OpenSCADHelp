# OpenSCADHelp
OpenSCAD Help Project is a compilation of help information about OpenSCAD and some libraries.

Any programming language has two parts to learn. The language syntax and himself instructions and the common libraries of constructed instructions.

If you search for help about OpenSCAD, you can find both kinds of help but dispersed over many websites and in many formats and access styles.

This project treats to compile all this help in a unique site. The intention is to have a unique form of search and found help about almost the most important things of OpenSCAD.

The libraries selected are going to be: MCAD, because is installed with OpenSCAD every time and others we consider standard, but the project is going to be open to new libraries and for new access styles for help.

# DocNHelp

The tool elected to develop the help files is DocNHelp: https://www.helpndoc.com/

Why a proprietary tool for developing a free product?

Basically to use the previous knowledge and start quickly. 
This election is open for a future change.

The advantages of HelpNDoc. 

HelpNDoc has a free version for personal use that I think is compatible with this project. 

HelpNDoc can generate, starting from the same font, CHM files for Microsoft Windows, eBooks for Amazon Kindle, PDF Files for standard readers and responsive HTML web sites.
